# Environment Variables Setup Summary

## 🎯 Quick Overview

Your contact form needs EmailJS credentials to send emails. Since GitHub Pages only serves static files, we need special handling for environment variables.

## 🔧 What's Been Set Up

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Automatically deploys your site when you push to main branch
- Securely injects EmailJS credentials from GitHub Secrets during build
- No sensitive data exposed in your repository

### 2. **Local Development Support**
- `.env` file for local development (not committed to Git)
- `setup-env.sh` script to easily create your local `.env` file
- Configuration in `src/config/emailjs.ts` that works with both local and production

### 3. **Security Measures**
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude all environment files
- GitHub Secrets for production credentials
- No hardcoded sensitive data in source code

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Local Development:
```bash
# Option 1: Use the setup script
./setup-env.sh

# Option 2: Create .env manually
echo "REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id" > .env
echo "REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id" >> .env
echo "REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key" >> .env

# Then start development
npm start
```

### For Production (GitHub Pages):
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
3. **Add these secrets**:
   - `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
4. **Push to main branch** - automatic deployment will handle the rest!

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get EmailJS Credentials
1. Follow `HOSTINGER_EMAIL_SETUP.md` to set up EmailJS with Hostinger
2. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key

### Step 2: Set Up Local Development
```bash
./setup-env.sh
```

### Step 3: Set Up Production
1. Add credentials to GitHub Secrets
2. Push to main branch
3. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy

### Step 4: Test
1. Test locally: `npm start`
2. Test production: Check your live site after deployment

## 🔍 How It Works

### Local Development:
```
.env file → React app → EmailJS → Emails sent
```

### Production (GitHub Pages):
```
GitHub Secrets → GitHub Actions → Build with env vars → Deploy → EmailJS → Emails sent
```

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

- ✅ **No secrets in repository** - All sensitive data in GitHub Secrets
- ✅ **Automatic deployment** - No manual handling of credentials
- ✅ **Environment separation** - Different credentials for dev/prod if needed
- ✅ **Version control safe** - `.env` files are ignored

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Contact form not working?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify GitHub Secrets are set correctly
3. Check GitHub Actions build logs
4. Test EmailJS credentials independently

### Local development issues?
1. Ensure `.env` file exists and has correct format
2. Restart development server after creating `.env`
3. Check that variable names start with `REACT_APP_`
