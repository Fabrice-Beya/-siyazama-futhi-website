        <p>
          If you are from South Africa, [Your Municipality/Organization Name]'s
          legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
          described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we
          collect and the specific context in which we collect it.
        </p>
        <p>[Your Municipality/Organization Name] may process your Personal Data because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We need to perform a contract with you (e.g., to provide a municipal service)</li>
          <li>You have given us consent to do so</li>
          <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests (e.g., to improve municipal services) and it's not overridden by your rights</li>
          <li>For payment processing purposes</li>
          <li>To comply with the law (e.g., municipal bylaws, national legislation)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Retention of Data</h2>
        <p>

          with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to
          retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes,
          and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Your Municipality/Organization Name] will also retain Usage Data for
          internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a
          shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen
          the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we
          are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Transfer Of Data</h2>

          Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and
          maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province,

          necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
          accordance with this Privacy Policy and POPIA, and no transfer of your
          Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless
